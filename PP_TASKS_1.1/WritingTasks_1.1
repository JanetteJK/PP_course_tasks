Programming project assignments 1.1
1.
Many public services would benefit from simulation, by not having to conduct large experiments with a great amount of people and resources.
For example, testing how many devices of certain sorts would be needed in hospitals.
An MRI machine would cost large amounts of money so having an excess of them laying around without use would be a waste of resources.
To test how many machines are needed without using simulation would take a very long time, along with the purchasing of these machines,
that may not be needed after all. Simulation also allows a system to be changed to test if the change would wield better results,
without having to change the system. Testing by changing the system directly would take far more time and resources,
not to mention possibly having to change the system multiple times. By simulating the system can be fully optimized before applying these changes.
According to task provided text, sustainability can be incorporated by reducing the server number in the system,
thus saving energy and making the system more eco-friendly.
