Orientation writing tasks 3
1.	If I know the percentual age distribution of the ages in my class, I can use these same percentages to reflect a 1000 people.
So if 1% of my class are 18 then 1% of 1000 people should be 18.
I can then calculate and divide the entire distribution by these percentages
and generate a random number between 1-100 to get random ages with the same probability percentage as in the class.
I can then use a for loop to reiterate this the number of times that I want (in this case 1000).

2.	Because the definition of a Singleton is that a class can only have one of these instances and it’s usually private,
hence you cannot make a ‘New’ singleton.

3.	A normal distribution is a bell-shaped symmetrical curve where the median and mean values are pretty much the same and at the centre peak.
These kinds of distributions are for example the height of men, foot size or birthweight of babies,
where the standard is the peak and fewer data points occur outside of the peak.
A uniform distribution is one where every outcome is equally likely, with no bias towards any outcome.
This can be for example rolling a six-sided die or flipping a coin.
